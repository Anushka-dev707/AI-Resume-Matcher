Windchimes! Tired of cribbing about how sick we were with the way communication was being done, we were left with little choice but to start off something on our own. And voila Windchimes saw the light of day! We would be lying through our teeth if we said, it was easy. It was anything but. To get hurled from the security of 9 to 5 jobs to the insanity of setting up a company was overwhelming on the good days. Dont even ask us about the bad days. What kept us going you ask? Our belief in the potential of social media. In our previous corporate avatars we often asked ourselves, How do we make communication more real, more human? Windchimes has become our answer. And every single day our faith gets reaffirmed that with social media we can change the way communication is done Download PPT Photo 1 Â View Contact Details
