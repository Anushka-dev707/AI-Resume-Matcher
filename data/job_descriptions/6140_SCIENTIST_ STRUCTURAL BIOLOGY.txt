SKILLS: Teaching

Job Description Â Send me Jobs like this PhD in Structural Biology or Biochemistry or other relevant fields. 2-4 yrs of postdoctoral/industry experience in the application of structural biology/protein chemistry set up Hands on experience in cloning, recombinant protein expression and purification Expertise in solving protein structure by crystallization, X-ray diffraction and related tools. Working knowledge of instruments such as protein fermenter, FPLC, circular dichroism, isothermal calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, Surface Plasmon resonance etc Must be detail oriented, well organized with ability to analyze and communicate data effectively Excellent teamwork is required to work in a fast-paced, multi-disciplinary environment JOB DESCRIPTION In this position you will coordinate with cell biologists, computational and medicinal chemists to understand the molecular nature of the protein-ligand and protein-drug interaction. Oversee and coordinate cloning, protein expression and purification Coordinate cross-departmental activities for the effective use of purified proteins Biophysical characterization of protein-ligand and protein-small molecule interaction Regular data analysis, project updates, literature survey and presentations on the target Participate in project team meeting and contribute to the projects intellectually DUTIES AND JOB FUNCTIONS The successful candidates will work in the area of protein science and structural biology, which include design, express, and purify proteins, and elucidate protein-protein interactions. Primary responsibilities include: Support protein design, expression and purification to support small-molecule discovery Biophysical characterization of proteins and protein-ligand complexes to facilitate protein crystallization and protein science studies (e.g. ITC, AUC, DSC, fluorescence) Design of protein constructs for SBDD and protein sciences experiments Integrating structural biology expertise into cross-functional project teams Lead determination of high quality protein structures and co-crystal structures through crystallization, data collection and refinement Communicating effectively with medicinal and computational chemists to translate hit to leads Salary: Not Disclosed by Recruiter Industry: Education / Teaching / Training Functional Area: Teaching , Education , Training , Counselling Role Category:Other Role:Fresher Keyskills SCIENTIST: STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY Desired Candidate Profile Education- UG: Any Graduate PG:Any Postgraduate Doctorate:Any Doctorate - Any Specialization, Doctorate Not Required Please refer to the Job description above Company Profile: Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine The Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), is a state-of-the-art research institute in Bangalore, India, dedicated to the study of stem cell and regenerative biology.An autonomous institute funded by the Dept of Biotechnology, Govt. of India, inStem emphasizes collaborative research in stem cell biology. inStems mandate to allow this cross-disciplinary, multi-pronged approach to research, straddles the divide between clinical and laboratory research in stem cell biology. In trying to answer intractable and challenging questions that face the field, inStem seeks to rewrite the paradigm of the research institute: without barriers and across disciplines.
