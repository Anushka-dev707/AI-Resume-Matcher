The idea is to differentiate FleAffair from other online portals in the country, and to cater to those who enjoy shopping from flea markets ( the likes of Dilli Haat etc.). Its a platform for niche sellers who may not have a branded shop but sell through stalls at renowned flea markets and platforms like Facebook/ Whatsapp etc. but how many of us do actually go and buy products from them, everyone is skeptical about direct payments / product quality / returns / reliability of the vendor. We bridge the gap between the Customer and these Vendors where we provide both a reliable platform (FleAffair.com) to buy / sell with assurance. FleAffair team ensures that each and every item is hand picked , unique and provides the best value to the customer at best prices. Download PPT Photo 1 Â View Contact Details
