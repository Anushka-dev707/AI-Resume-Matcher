RED APPLE TRAVEL GROUP is proud to say that no one knows Asia like we do. Thanks to years of experience, we have learnt how to handle every individual traveler\'s varied needs and have successfully entered not only the leisure tourism industry but also ventured into Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibitions (MICE) and Religious Tourism markets, adding a completely new dimension to the company\'s bouquet of services. We\'ve now expanded our horizon to enter the highly competitive transport, and events business. We have also set up our own chain of restaurants throughout the Far East as individual Strategic Business Units (SBU) between Thailand and Malaysia, and opening shortly in Bangkok and Singapore. On the transport front, through carefully chosen strategic acquisitions, we have taken over large transport companies throughout the east. With a dedicated fleet of coaches, luxury sedans and vans in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, the transport division works like a separate SBU selling its services to other players in the inbound market throughout the East.
