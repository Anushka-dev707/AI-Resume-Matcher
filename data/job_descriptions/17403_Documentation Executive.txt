The Gap The rapidly growing exploration and production (E&P) activities in India has attracted more and more global operators and contractors to come to India. Thus all exploration related equipment and consumables are brought from outside the country and have to be returned back to the country of origin after completion of service. This leads to multiple re-imports increasing the possibility of in transit loss or damage to the equipment besides the time and costs involved in arranging and executing the logistics and necessary documentation.
