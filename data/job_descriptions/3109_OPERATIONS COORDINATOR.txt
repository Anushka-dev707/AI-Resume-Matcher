The Indian local (intra-city) trucking industry is worth USD 15 billion. Trucks transport around 2 billion tons of freight across the country every year. That's close to 60% of all freight tonnage in India, including rail, water and air. However, the market remains extremely fragmented with no dominant players in the industry. While trucking companies operating with 1-5 trucks account for 80% of market revenue, even large players have no more than 50 vehicles in their fleet. These large companies often do not own the whole fleet, and instead contract out to independent owner-operators. Download PPT Photo 1 Â View Contact Details
