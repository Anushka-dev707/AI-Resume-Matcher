Its first project was Mann ke ManjeerÃÂ© (An Album of Women's Dreams), an award-winning music album and video compilation that stirred unprecedented discussion across India about women's rights and brought the problem of domestic violence out from behind closed doors. Today, Breakthrough works to activate the critical mass of people who will deliver the culture change needed to make violence against women and girls unacceptable worldwide. Over the last 15 years working on preventing Violence against Women & Girls, Breakthrough has a deep understanding of the interlinkages between its various manifestations.
