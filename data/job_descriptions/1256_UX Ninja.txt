TITLE: UX Ninja

SKILLS: IT Software - Application Programming

Job Description Â Send me Jobs like this We're trying to build things that are an absolute delight to use. If you're someone who questions everything, and we mean everything - why toothpicks have a groove on one end, how Apple thought up their disappearing battery indicator, why commonplace things like chairs and tables are designed the way they are, why a color scheme was used somewhere - we want you! We're looking for someone with a sharp sense of what a consumer goes through while using an interface or product or service. Previous experience in UX will help - we will have some of your previous work to assess your thinking process. Basic skill with front end web technology will help you execute ideas as fast as you think them up. You will be the UX design lead, and work with our engineering and marketing teams to build things that will directly drive company goals - sales and otherwise. We love people who figure out, plan and drive their own projects with a strong sense of individuality. Once you prove yourself, you will have free reign to experiment with user/consumer behavior, buyer psychology and just plain building cool things.
